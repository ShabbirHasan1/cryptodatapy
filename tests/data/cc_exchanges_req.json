When customers attempted a withdrawal they were told that their account was frozen due to \"suspicious activity.\" One user was told that a Romanian police officer had requested that they take \"necessary measures\" against their account. The user in question had absolutely no ties to Romania. Other users have reported a similar pattern of \"suspicious activity\" and police requests.\nDuring this time, the exchange has continued to tweet and otherwise display normal online activity. Users who have attempted to complain on Twitter have found their accounts blocked.\nIn researching this exchange, we found that the company registered as the operator of this exchange in the UK is Exchange Cloud Limited, and the person in control of that company is Oluwasegun Oni. A review of his LinkedIn shows an extensive work history but no mention of this exchange. If the exchange was as successful as they claim, we would expect him to proudly display it in his work history! That said, our research did not turn up any other suspicious behavior on his part, so far.\nExtStock is also accused of reporting inflated volume. Their bitcoin price is higher than on other exchanges, which is inspiring users to transfer their funds to the exchange in hopes of selling at a profit, only to find their BTC locked into the exchange due to the aforementioned accusations of \"suspicious activity.\"\nWhile we cannot find conclusive proof that ExtStock is planning an exit scheme or suffering from a lack of reserves, we do find their behavior concerning enough to mark it as a SCAM and warn users not to transfer their funds to this exchange.\"", "FullAddress": "14 Cunningham House Pump House Crescent, Brentford, Middlesex, TW8 0FY", "Fees": "Trading fee: 0.2%", "DepositMethods": "Cryptocurrency\nFiat", "WithdrawalMethods": "Cryptocurrency\nFiat", "Sponsored": false, "Recommended": false, "Rating": {"One": 3, "Two": 0, "Three": 1, "Four": 7, "Five": 5, "Avg": 3.6, "TotalUsers": 16}, "SortOrder": "99", "TOTALVOLUME24H": {"BTC": 0}, "DISPLAYTOTALVOLUME24H": {"BTC": "\u0243 0"}}, "837358": {"Id": "837358", "Name": "Bitbank", "Url": "/exchanges/bitbank/overview", "LogoUrl": "/media/30001896/bitbank.jpg", "ItemType": ["Cryptocurrency", "Fiat"], "CentralizationType": "Centralized", "InternalName": "BitBank", "GradePoints": 62.98, "Grade": "BB", "GradePointsSplit": {"Legal": "12.9", "KYCAndTransactionRisk": "8.3", "Team": "5.6", "DataProvision": "9.6", "AssetQualityAndDiversity": "4.3", "MarketQuality": "13.9", "Security": "8.5", "NegativeReportsPenalty": "0"}, "AffiliateURL": "https://bitbank.cc/", "Country": "Japan", "OrderBook": true, "Trades": true, "Description": "Bitbank exchange has it Servers Centers based in Japan and is fully licensed from the Japanese Financial Services Agency (JFSA).

TRXMarket, now named Poloni DEX, will operate under the umbrella of Poloniex. Users looking for decentralized trading services can find them on the Poloniex official website or by going straight to Poloni DEX at poloniex.org.\nTelegram | Weibo |\u00a0Medium", "FullAddress": "Unknown", "Fees": "Maker Fee: 0.01%\nTaker Fee: 0.075%\n\nIn order to access the Poloni DEX fees details, please click <a href=\"https://poloniex.com/fee-schedule\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.", "DepositMethods": "Cryptocurrency\n\nIn order to access the Poloni DEX fees details, please click <a href=\"https://poloniex.com/fee-schedule\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.", "WithdrawalMethods": "Cryptocurrency\n\nIn order to access the Poloni DEX fees details, please click <a href=\"https://poloniex.com/fee-schedule\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.", "Sponsored": false, "Recommended": false, "Rating": {"One": 0, "Two": 0, "Three": 0, "Four": 0, "Five": 1, "Avg": 3.1, "TotalUsers": 1}, "SortOrder": "224", "TOTALVOLUME24H": {"BTC": 0}, "DISPLAYTOTALVOLUME24H": {"BTC": "\u0243 0"}}, "929728": {"Id": "929728", "Name": "AliExchange", "Url": "/exchanges/aliexchange/overview", "LogoUrl": "/media/35521286/aliexchange.png", "ItemType": ["Cryptocurrency", "Fiat"], "CentralizationType": "Centralized", "InternalName": "aliexchange", "GradePoints": 25.86, "Grade": "D", "GradePointsSplit": {"Legal": "6.4", "KYCAndTransactionRisk": "3.4", "Team": "1.9", "DataProvision": "3.6", "AssetQualityAndDiversity": "5", "MarketQuality": "0", "Security": "5.5", "NegativeReportsPenalty": "0"}, "AffiliateURL": "https://www.aliexchange.com/", "Country": "Estonia", "OrderBook": false, "Trades": true, "Description": "Founded in 2018, AliExchange is an institutional-grade cryptocurrency exchange based in Estonia, Europe.\u00a0AliExchange\u2019s trading platform is being built on Wall Street Trading Technology.

Each Uniswap v1 pair stores pooled reserves of two assets, and provides liquidity for those two assets, maintaining the invariant that the product of the reserves cannot decrease. Traders pay a 30-basis-point fee on trades, which goes to liquidity providers. The contracts are non-upgradeable.\nUniswap v2 is a new implementation based on the same formula, with several new highly-desirable features. Most significantly, it enables the creation of arbitrary ERC20/ERC20 pairs, rather than supporting only pairs between ERC20 and ETH. It also provides a hardened price oracle that accumulates the relative price of the two assets at the beginning of each block. This allows other contracts on Ethereum to estimate the time-weighted average price for the two assets over arbitrary intervals. Finally, it enables \u201cflash swaps\u201d where users can receive assets freely and use them elsewhere\u00a0on the chain, only paying for (or returning) those assets at the end of the transaction.\nIn Uniswap v3, when compared to Uniswap and Uniswap v2, Liquidity Providers have more control over where they are able to place their capital. Liquidity Providers in Uniswapv 3 are able to use their capital in more flexible and narrower price ranges that were not previously possible in Uniswapv2. This means that Liquidity Providers can collect more fees for less capital. Also, traders who want to trade or exchange their tokens will enjoy prices that are closer to where they want to complete their exchange.", "FullAddress": "Unknown", "Fees": "Uniswap v3 offers three different fee tiers: 0.05%, 0.30%, and 1.00%.
